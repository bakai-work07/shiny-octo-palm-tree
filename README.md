## ðŸ”¢ Simple Linear Regression in PyTorch

This is my implementation of a basic linear regression model using PyTorch, based on the excellent tutorial "
PyTorch for Deep Learning & Machine Learning â€“ Full Course" by Daniel Bourke.

The purpose of this project is to practice and better understand:
- PyTorch's training loop (forward/backward pass)
- GPU usage
- Model saving/loading
- Basic data visualization

I've added comments and some personal notes to help solidify my learning.
